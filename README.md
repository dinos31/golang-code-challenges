## variable declaration

you can use the following syntax to declare variables in go

    var myInt int

this structure is as follows : var keyword, the name of you variable, your variable's type.

after declaration you can give it a value or "initialize the variable"
like this

    myInt = 5

or you can also declare and initialize a variable at the same time

    var myInt int = 5
